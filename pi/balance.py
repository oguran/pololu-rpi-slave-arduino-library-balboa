# This code was developed for a Balboa unit using 50:1 motors
# and 45:21 plastic gears, for an overall gear ratio of 111.
# Adjust the ratio below to scale various constants in the
# balancing algorithm to match your robot.
GEAR_RATIO = 111

# This constant limits the maximum motor speed.  If your gear
# ratio is lower than what we used, or if you are testing
# changes to the code, you might want to reduce it to prevent
# your robot from zooming away when things go wrong.
MOTOR_SPEED_LIMIT = 300

# This constant relates the angle to its rate of change for a
# robot that is falling from a nearly-vertical position or
# rising up to that position.  The relationship is nearly
# linear.  For example, if you have the 80mm wheels it should be
# about 140, which means that the angle in millidegrees is ~140
# times its rate of change in degrees per second; when the robot
# has fallen by 90 degrees it will be moving at about
# 90,000/140 = 642 deg/s.  See the end of Balancer.ino for one
# way to calibrate this value.
ANGLE_RATE_RATIO = 140

# The following three constants define a PID-like algorithm for
# balancing.  Each one determines how much the motors will
# respond to the corresponding variable being off from zero.
# See the code in Balance.cpp for exactly how they are used.  To
# get it balancing from scratch, start with them all at zero and
# adjust them as follows:

# ANGLE_RESPONSE determines the response to a combination of
# angle and angle_rate; the combination measures how far the
# robot is from a stable trajectory.  To test this, use your
# hand to flick the robot up from a resting position.  With a
# value that is too low, it won't stop itself in time; a high
# value will cause it to slam back into the ground or oscillate
# wildly back and forth.  When ANGLE_RESPONSE is adjusted
# properly, the robot will move just enough to stop itself.
# However, after stopping itself, it will be moving and keep
# moving in the same direction, usually driving faster and
# faster until it reaches its maximum motor speed and falls
# over.  That's where the next constants come in.
ANGLE_RESPONSE = 12

# DISTANCE_RESPONSE determines how much the robot resists being
# moved away from its starting point.  Counterintuitively, this
# constant is positive: to move forwards, the robot actually has
# to first roll its wheels backwards, so that it can *fall*
# forwards.  When this constant is adjusted properly, the robot
# will no longer zoom off in one direction, but it will drive
# back and forth a few times before falling down.
DISTANCE_RESPONSE = 90

# DISTANCE_DIFF_RESPONSE determines the response to differences
# between the left and right motors, preventing undesired
# rotation due to differences in the motors and gearing.  Unlike
# DISTANCE_REPONSE, it should be negative: if the left motor is
# lagging, we need to increase its speed and decrease the speed
# of the right motor.  If this constant is too small, the robot
# will spin left and right as it rocks back and forth; if it is
# too large it will become unstable.
DISTANCE_DIFF_RESPONSE = -50

# SPEED_RESPONSE supresses the large back-and-forth oscillations
# caused by DISTANCE_RESPONSE.  Increase this until these
# oscillations die down after a few cycles; but if you increase
# it too much it will tend to shudder or vibrate wildly.
SPEED_RESPONSE = 3300

# The balancing code is all based on a 100 Hz update rate; if
# you change this, you will have to adjust many other things.
UPDATE_TIME = 0.01

# Take 100 measurements initially to calibrate the gyro.
